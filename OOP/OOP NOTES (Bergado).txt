Procedural Programming
-Writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data

OOP Programming
-You create objects that contain data and methods.
Ex. 
A book is an object.
If I said "You read" that is a method

Advantages of OOP:
- Faster and easier to execute.
- Provide a clear structure for the programs.
- Helps to keep the Java code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Make it possible to create fully reusable applications with 
  less code and shorter development time.
- Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Inheritance.
